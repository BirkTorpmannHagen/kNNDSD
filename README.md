Note: this is WIP, refactoring is required 
## Repeating Experiments
To repeat experiments, first train a suitable representation model (i.e. using Glow/VAE/ResNet Classifier/ Segmentation). Change the path in the corresponding testbed to reflect the checkpoint path, then run eval_detectors on the corresponding testbed. 

To generate metrics and plots, refer to plots.py
