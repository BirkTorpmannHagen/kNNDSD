Note: repeating experiments requires some manual changes to the code. This will be addressed soon.
To collect data on a given dataset, train a model, then run the relevant function in eval_detectors.py. Metrics are computed with a corresponding function in plots.py
All collected data is available in .csv files in data/. These can be analyzed from plots.py as is.
